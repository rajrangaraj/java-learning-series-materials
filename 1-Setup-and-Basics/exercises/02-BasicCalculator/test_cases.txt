Test Case 1:
Input:
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

Expected Output:
Addition: 10 + 5 = 15
Subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5
Multiplication: 10 * 5 = 50
Division: 10 / 5 = 2

-------------------
Test Case 2:
Input:
number1 = 7.5
number2 = 2.5

Expected Output:
Addition: 7.5 + 2.5 = 10.0
Subtraction: 7.5 - 2.5 = 5.0
Multiplication: 7.5 * 2.5 = 18.75
Division: 7.5 / 2.5 = 3.0

-------------------
Test Case 3:
Input:
number1 = 15
number2 = 0

Expected Output:
Addition: 15 + 0 = 15
Subtraction: 15 - 0 = 15
Multiplication: 15 * 0 = 0
Division: Cannot divide by zero

-------------------
Test Case 4:
Input:
number1 = -10
number2 = 3

Expected Output:
Addition: -10 + 3 = -7
Subtraction: -10 - 3 = -13
Multiplication: -10 * 3 = -30
Division: -10 / 3 = -3.333333

Note: For division results, rounding to 6 decimal places is acceptable.
