# Exercise 1: First Program

## Objective
Create a simple Java program that demonstrates basic variable usage and printing to console by displaying personal information and performing a simple calculation.

## Requirements
1. Create variables to store:
   - Your name (as a String)
   - Your age (as an integer)
   - The current year (as an integer)

2. Calculate your birth year using:
   - Current year minus your age
   - Store in a variable

3. Print to console:
   - Your name
   - Your age
   - Your calculated birth year

## Expected Format 
My name is [your name]
I am [your age] years old
I was born in [birth year]

## Tips
- Use appropriate variable names (descriptive and in camelCase)
- Remember to use proper data types
- Use System.out.println() for printing
- String concatenation can be done using the + operator

## Example
java:1-Setup-and-Basics/exercises/01-FirstProgram/README.md
String name = "John Doe";
System.out.println("My name is " + name);

## Testing
- Use the provided test cases in test_cases.txt
- Test with different names and ages
- Verify output format matches exactly

## Common Issues
- Remember to initialize all variables
- Check string quotes and semicolons
- Verify mathematical operations
